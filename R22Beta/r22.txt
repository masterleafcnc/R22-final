make cabal attack animation sync with weapon reload time (particle beams).
fix buggy detector showing always.
mok mag mines should not attach to dozer scorps.
mok heavily damaged shredder not showing quads sometimes.
reckoner when deployed crusher level - less.
bh and nod engineers can not be crushed (lol).
investigate reckoner not ranking up.
make growth stimulator show blue on blue field, fireweapon once and make it only target a blue field. if the blue field is detected, assign a user state without expiry to the growth stimulator that makes the texture switch to blue and fx if there are some.
remove the infantry pips from vehicle v35, and the dust fx it shows in formation preview.
investigate animation of redeemer rage so its exactly in sync when triggering ability. (wont do this).
nod mcv geometry change to make it move between structures easier.
trigger special power from a weapon with a random reload for the beam cannon, use weapon ability instead for trigger so it combines more often.
remove animation state from formation preview of behemoth.
make all crystals from overlords wrath harvestable/used for charging tripods/dev tanks.
t59 pac isnt compiled in the patch stream (closing tag wasnt included in the comment).

fix multi bh commando.
stasis and wormhole interaction, fix it , make 2nd weapon with smaller radius as a workaround with attribute modifier no fx.
remove SPECIAL_ABILITY_PACKING_UNPACKING_OR_USING on NodShadow gameobject so it doesnt unstealth when lifting off.

I really want to nerf ceramic armor firehawks
imo its objectively op
i dont even build them because i think its disgusting
how abusive they are
Masterleaf — Today at 22:26
oh ye
that glow mesh under devastators and pacs
should have a bigger bounding box
thats more important than the shield
it disappears currently way too soon
was trying to rmemeber what i was thinking of when i woke up
it was that
random thought

cranes infantry when sold off.
reduce shatterer sink time slightly increase obbox.

raise redeemer death voice volume.

fix the commandeer bug (apply 1.03 script).
Add unfair advantage map to map pack.


— HUSK IDEA —

players when i did that did the mistake once
[
21:36
]
they thought it was buffed
[
21:36
]
the white circle represents the radius
[
21:36
]
in r21

Masterleaf

Today at 21:44
but yeah
[
21:44
]
small things make a difference
[
21:44

if you are aware of them

the jugg tripod and avatar have like 10 animations when dying
[
22:14
]
but only one is used because the game needs to load a husk model when destroyed
[
22:15
]
if i can somehow save the aniimation the game chose (at random) when dying
[
22:15
]
i can make the husk model be the same
[
22:15
]
so every death of walkers would be different
[
22:15
]
i might iinvest some time in it this summer

StrauS

Today at 22:15
sounds funny

Masterleaf
—
Today at 22:15
ea made a lot of animations
[
22:15
]
and you only see one of them
[
22:16
]
and the game can randomize the death animations
[
22:16
]
the problem is the husk model is always the same
[
22:16
]
unless i can capture the random animation the game used
[
22:16
]
would be sick man
[
22:16
]
imagine like 12 different death animations across those units

StrauS
—
Today at 22:16
It would be really cool

Masterleaf
—
Today at 22:17
and husk model wouldnt be same too
[
22:17
]
you would see variations

StrauS
—
Today at 22:17
lso

Masterleaf
—
Today at 22:17
this might be the main visual difference with r22
[
22:17
]
i always have some big feature for these big releases
StrauS
lso

StrauS

why there is sometimes husks which are not possible to capture?
[
22:17
]
with eng

Masterleaf
—
Today at 22:18
and i think this if i can get it to work
[
22:18
]
would be good
@StrauS
why there is sometimes husks which are not possible to capture?

Masterleaf
—
Today at 22:18
ill investigate this
[
22:18
]
i think its the selection box

StrauS
—
Today at 22:18
underground
[
22:18
]
maybe

Masterleaf
—
Today at 22:18
it has to do wiith terrain
[
22:19
]
though really i h avent had a single instance in r21
[
22:19
]
of being unable to capture a husk
[
22:19
]
not even once
[
22:20
]
So i could assign a random variable to the tripod (edited)
[
22:20
]
And depending on this variable
[
22:20
]
A specific animation husk is used
[
22:20
]
When tripod made this variable will be set
[
22:21
]
I know this works
[
22:21
]
Because zone trooper skins are randomized (edited)
[
22:21
]
As you know

StrauS
—
Today at 22:22
Yes

Masterleaf
—
Today at 22:23
so tripod made -> game makes a random user which is irrelevant until its destroyed , then this loads the animation
[
22:23
]
easy

StrauS
—
Today at 22:23
More like linking husk to animation
[
22:23
]
Or maybe developing new husks pose
[
22:23
]
Will main work

Masterleaf
—
Today at 22:23
i wiill need to create husk models
[
22:23
]
this is easy
[
22:23
]
basically the final frame of the husk animation = the model
[
22:24
]
i only need to export the husk with 3ds max 9
[
22:24
]
from the last frame of all the animations
[
22:24
]
some are funny
[
22:25
]
there is one sad one with tripod
[
22:25
]
it struggling to walk and in pain
[
22:25
]
and then collapsing
[
22:25
]
bringing all this content never seen before into the game
[
22:25
]
will make it refreshing

— HUSK IDEA –

Make fanatics blow up when killed.


MANTIS –

Masterleaf

Today at 23:18
2.5s reload
[
23:18
]
and 5 rockets
[
23:18
]
will make it identical to now
[
23:18
]
but it shoots sooner from factory

StrauS

Today at 23:18
How many rockets need to take zocom hh?

Masterleaf
—
Today at 23:19
that has 2600hp * 1.33
Masterleaf
will make it identical to now

StrauS

Today at 23:19
It will less overkill so its better

Masterleaf

mantis without upgrade deals 375 per rocket

StrauS

Today at 23:20
Seems 2 shots

Masterleaf
—
Today at 23:20
about 9-10 rockets per hh

StrauS
—
Today at 23:20
Okay

Masterleaf

Today at 23:20
without tib core)

StrauS

Shadow teams/vertigos should not be revealed whilst airborne by infantry.

Increase decal boundingbox like repair radius so it doesnt disappear offf the edge of screen.

Fixed a bug involving pac shields not resisting emp.
